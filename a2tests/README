Some test files for assignment 2
---------------------------------
We assume that the file "data" doesn't exist at the start.  The output
were generated by the following commands on a Linux system:

./a2 data < in1 > out1
./a2 data1 < in2 > out2
./a2 data1 < in3 > out3
./a2 data2 < in4 > out4

Note that the program may modify the data file.  The first 3 tests use the
same data file which may be modified after each test.  For example, the 
third test depends on the data file "created" by the second test.  The fourth 
test uses a different data file which is provided.

If you re-run all the tests from the beginning, you'll need to delete "data"
& "data1" & use the original "data2"

Note that all input, output & data files are in Unix format.

Note that test 1 involves invalid input.  Basically there should be no output
(i.e. out1 is empty)

Test 3 basically test whether your program can load a data file.  It depends
on the data file created in test 2.

You may be able to use the runtests script to run the tests.
